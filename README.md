# huntabyte.com (under construction)
A work in progress build of my personal website. The goal of this site is to serve as my home on the web. I intend for this site to be focused on content, consisting of articles, snippets, tools, etc.

This project has become a sort of lab for myself. I have been experimenting with technologies/approaches that I am not super familiar with, but would like to be.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)

## Disclaimer
I only decided to make this repo public as a work in progress so that anyone interested could follow along and see what I'm up to. Once I finish what I would call a "v1", I intend on doing a write-up of how it's built and working in more detail.
